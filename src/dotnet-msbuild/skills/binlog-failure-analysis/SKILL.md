# Analyzing MSBuild Failures with Binary Logs

When an MSBuild build fails, use the binlog-mcp tool to deeply analyze the failure. This skill guides you through generating a binary log and using the MCP tools to diagnose issues.
Requires 'binlog-mcp' MCP server tools to perform the binlog analysis.

## Step 1: Generate a Binary Log

Re-run the failed build command with the `/bl` flag to generate a binary log file:

```bash
# For dotnet builds
dotnet build /bl

# For msbuild directly
msbuild /bl

# Custom binlog filename
dotnet build /bl:build.binlog
```

The `/bl` flag tells MSBuild to generate a `msbuild.binlog` file (or the specified filename) in the current directory. Use `/bl:{}` (or `/bl:{{}}` in powershell for escaping) to generate unique binlog filename on each run.

## Step 2: Load the Binary Log

Use the `load_binlog` tool to load the generated binlog file:

```
load_binlog with path: "<absolute-path-to-binlog>"
```

This must be called before using any other binlog analysis tools. Returns `InterestingBuildData` containing total duration in milliseconds and node count.

## Step 3: Analyze the Failure

### Get Diagnostics (Errors and Warnings)

Use `get_diagnostics` to extract all errors and warnings:

```
get_diagnostics with:
  - binlog_file: "<path>"
  - includeErrors: true
  - includeWarnings: true
  - includeDetails: true
  - projectIds: [optional array of project IDs to filter]
  - targetIds: [optional array of target IDs to filter]
  - taskIds: [optional array of task IDs to filter]
  - maxResults: [optional max number of diagnostics]
```

Returns `DiagnosticAnalysisResult` with severity classification (Error, Warning, Info), source locations, file paths, line numbers, and context information.

### Search for Specific Issues

Use `search_binlog` with the powerful query language to find specific issues:

```
search_binlog with:
  - binlog_file: "<path>"
  - query: "error CS1234"        # Find specific error codes
  - query: "$task Csc"           # Find all C# compilation tasks
  - query: "under($project MyProject)"  # Find nodes under a specific project
  - maxResults: 300              # Default limit
  - includeDuration: true        # Include timing info
  - includeContext: true         # Include project/target/task IDs
```

### Investigate Expensive Operations

If the build is slow or timing out:

```
get_expensive_targets with binlog_file and top_number: 10
get_expensive_tasks with binlog_file and top_number: 10
get_expensive_projects with binlog_file, top_number: 10, sortByExclusive: true
```

The `get_expensive_projects` tool supports:
- `excludeTargets`: Array of target names to exclude (e.g., ['Copy', 'CopyFilesToOutputDirectory'])
- `sortByExclusive`: Sort by exclusive time (true) or inclusive time (false)

### Analyze Roslyn Analyzers

If compilation is slow, check analyzer performance:

```
get_expensive_analyzers with binlog_file and top_number: 10
```

Returns aggregated analyzer data with execution count, total/average/min/max durations.

For specific Csc task analyzer details:
```
get_task_analyzers with binlog_file, projectId, targetId, taskId
```

## Cross-Reference: Related Knowledge Base Skills

After identifying errors from binlog analysis, consult these specialized skills for in-depth guidance:

### By Failure Category
| Category | Skill to Consult |
|----------|-----------------|
| Output path conflicts / intermittent failures | `check-bin-obj-clash` |
| Slow builds (not errors, but performance) | `build-perf-diagnostics` |
| Incremental build broken (rebuilds everything) | `incremental-build` |

### Common Error Patterns Quick-Lookup
When binlog analysis reveals these patterns, here's the fast path:

1. **"Package X could not be found"** → Check NuGet feed configuration and authentication
2. **"The imported project was not found" (MSB4019)** → Check SDK install and global.json configuration
3. **"Reference assemblies not found" (MSB3644)** → Missing targeting pack, install the required workload
4. **"Found conflicts between different versions" (MSB3277)** → Check binding redirects and package version alignment
5. **"Package downgrade detected" (NU1605)** → Check package version resolution and constraints
6. **Multiple evaluation of same project** → Check `eval-performance` for overbuilding diagnosis
7. **Build succeeds but is very slow** → Use `build-perf-diagnostics` and the `build-perf` agent

### Decision Tree: When to Generate a New Binlog

- **Existing binlog is available and recent** → Load and analyze it first
- **Existing binlog is stale** (code or config changed since) → Generate fresh binlog
- **No binlog exists** → Generate one using `binlog-generation` skill conventions
- **Binlog analysis is inconclusive** → Regenerate with higher verbosity: `dotnet build /bl /v:diag`
- **Multiple build configurations failing** → Generate separate binlogs per configuration

## Tips

- The binlog contains embedded source files - use `list_files_from_binlog` and `get_file_from_binlog` to view them
- Use `maxResults` parameter to limit large result sets
- Use `get_target_info_by_id` instead of `get_target_info_by_name` when you have the ID for better performance
- Use `get_project_target_times` to get all target times in one call instead of querying individually
- Results from `get_expensive_projects` and `get_project_build_time` are cached for performance
- The binlog captures the complete build state, making it ideal for reproducing and diagnosing issues
